I was booted out of the insane asylum at personetics
I have a feeling the whole department will collapse soon after
I must make a name as a programmer and build on my strengths
while patching up the weaknesses
present an attractive resume
build new social connections
learn linux
git 
jenkins
python development
javascript and web design elements
I must have good habits
I must not allow my problems to infect me.
and within a year I will find a better place!
near my home, with interesting normal people
advance for 3-5 years there.
some stuff thats not about development and can side track me:
-don't watch a lot of videos, lurk wikipedia, and treat feelings
do heroic deeds
approach girls and sex them
become more centered
hack my biology
and enjoy the moment more often
